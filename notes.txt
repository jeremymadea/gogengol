Rules are two (dead and live) 256-bit sequences. The current state of the cell
dictates which of the two sequences to use. The 256 bit positions represent the
256 different states for a cell's Moore neighborhood. The bit value dictates 
the cell's next state. 

By convention, the bit order for the neighborhood is as follows: 

0 1 2 
7 . 3
6 5 4

Example: 

0 0 0 
0 . 1 = 00011010  (LSB first) = 01011000 (MSB first) = 88
1 0 1
